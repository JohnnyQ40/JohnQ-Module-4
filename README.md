# JohnQ-Module4
This project creats a timed quiz using html, css, and javascript. it quizzes the user on javascript based questions and gives them a final score. Users are given 60 seconds initially, but time is subtracted for every incorrect answer. When the game is over, the score is given and the user is prompted to add their initials to save their score. The scores are added to a high scores list where it displays the scores/initials in decending order from highest to lowest score.
